# SKLearn-SVR

 Support Vector Regression (SVR) has the same principles as Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the case of classification. The difference is that in the classification case, SVM tries to find the largest 'path' that can separate samples from different classes, whereas SVR in the regression case tries to find a 'path' that can accommodate as many samples as possible in it.
